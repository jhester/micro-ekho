TODO
√ 1 - Create five pretend arrays to send data over BT from Teensy to test that connection and app display
√ 2 - Make sure data connection between teensy and phone is perfect (with ID's always showing up etc)
√ 2 - App needs to remove any graphs that have no data in past one second (run every second a search maybe)
√ 3 - Change android app to support this many graphs, show node ID number on top
√ 4 - Android app, add aggregate / total expected energy information graph, in a different color, assume 1µA current
√ 5 - Send screensoht to TIM of app on handheld
√ 5 - Change code on msp430 to sample constantly and only send max values over a time period, add in a circular buffer
√ 6 - Add sync mode for msp430's to sync with basestation the first time they send, each msp430 needs to recieve for a bit after
√ 7 - add sync time sharing to basestation

Node + Basestation
- fix data transfer protocol
- Send more data points quicker
- make lag shorter for data transfer
- add low power modes to msp430

Assembly
- Replace all RST resistors with 47k
- Build four devices
- Test them all
- Glue 4-5 enclosures in the morning with magnets
- Once tested and all working, solder on battery connectors
- Put batteries in the connectors and test

App General
√ - Allow mock BLE connection (debug mode)
√ - Allow mock data to be used in-app (debug mode)

App: Page: Connect
√ - Add instructions for connecting to the Bluetooth module
√ - Add refresh button for BLE connection to rescan
√ - Show row with no devices found

App: Page: Main
- Add disconnect button
√ - Make graphs span entire width of screen. Two per window on Nexus 7.
√ - Add maximize / minimize button on graph bar
√ - Show max power since arbitrary start in header bar, calculate once a second
√ - Show total energy since arbitrary start, calculate once a second
√ - Show options window when clicking title on graph (show figure settings)
- Maximize / full screen a single graph

App: Popup: options
√ - Allow change title of graph in optoins
√ - Set average harvestable current
√ - Allow reset of statistics

Finishing Up Questions:
- Name of the app == Powerfelt
- App icons / artwork and splash screens (if can provide vector image or high resolution logo I can do this myself)



Max voltage per person, total power using estimated current
Settings bar, show assumed current 

Change names, select graph UI box
Maximize minimize buttons on UI bar or graph
Estimated current, settable in UI box
Check box, actual voltage or absolute value (software rectification)
